# tinyib-mappy Imageboard

This is something I worked with during my first year in engineering as a learning project to get a hang of basic web development skills like php, sql, html and css. Uploaded here to my github for archiving purposes.

**A fork of [tinyib-mappy](https://git.ivysaur.me/code.ivysaur.me/tinyib-mappy) with minor cosmetic and functional changes.**

# What is an Imageboard?

An [Imageboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard) is a type of Internet forum that revolves around the posting of images, often alongside text and discussion. They're known to be the backbone of early internet culture and even contributing to modern internet culture till this day. The first imageboards were created in Japan as an extension of the [textboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textboard) concept. 

In some ways imageboards are the complete opposite of social media with no account registeration or logins, just pure anonymous discussion.
