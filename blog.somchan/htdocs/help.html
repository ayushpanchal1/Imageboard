            <p>This is the main board where you will see all the threads. 
            <br>Use the buttons on the bottom left to switch pages and click 
            <br>on "return" to go back to the previous page or the somchan logo on top of the 
            <br>page to go back to the board if you get lost. The threads/posts are ordered 
            <br>based on popularity, with the most popular threads on the first/front page.
            <br>There can be a maximum of 35 threads (7 on each page).</p>

            <br>How to post a thread?
        </span>
        <span class="text">
            <p><br>Use the section below the somchan logo to post a thread. The post should 
            <br>contain at least a message or an image to post. Leaving the name field empty will
            <br>show your name as "Anonymous". You can view a thread by clicking on the subject in 
            <br>purple. You can also do it by clicking on the "No." button or the "View thread"
            <br>button on the line with the date and time of the post.<p>
            
            <p><br>You can delete threads and replies by clicking on the red "X" button, 
            <br>you can delete posts until 5 minutes from the time of posting</p>
        </span>
        <span class="title">
            <br>How do I post a reply?
        </span>
        
        <span class="text">
            <p><br>Click on "No.", "View Thread" or the subject to view the thread. Now you'll 
            <br>see the textbox at the bottom of the page from where you can post your reply.
            <br>Again, at least an image or a message is required.</p>

            <p><br>Ticking the "bump" box next to the "post reply" button before posting will
            <br>make your reply contribute to the popularity of the thread, bringing it up
            <br>closer to the front page. Bump stands for "Bring Up My Post".</p>

        <span class="text">
            <p><br>You can click on the post number after "No." on a post to mention that post
            <br>in your post/reply. It will generate a text in the format ">>PostNumber" 
            <br>in your textbox, press enter on your keyboard to skip to the next line to  
            <br>continue your message. Manually doing this by typing out ">>" then the post 
            <br>number works too.</p>

            <p><br>Typing out ">" before a text marks it in green. It is typically used to
            <br>quote a person's post.</p>
