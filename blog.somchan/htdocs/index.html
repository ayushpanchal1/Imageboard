        </span>
        
        <span class="text">
            <p><br>somchan is a messageboard based on <a href="https://code.ivysaur.me/tinyib-mappy" style="text-decoration: none;">"tinyib-mappy"</a>. 
            <br>It stands for "server oriented messageboard".
            <br>(I definitely did not just make that up)</p>

            <br>What is an imageboard?
        </span>
        <span class="text">
            <p><br>According to Wikipedia "An imageboard is a type of Internet forum that  
            <br>revolves around the posting of images, often alongside text and discussion. 
            <br>The first imageboards were created in Japan as an 
            <br>extension of the textboard concept."
            <br>In some ways it is the complete opposite of social media with no
            <br>account registeration or logins, just pure anonymous discussions.<p>
            
            <p><br>Basically anti-social-social-media-before-social-media-was-a-thing...?
            <br>If that sounds like a mouthful, you could always just call it an imageboard.</p>
        </span>
        <span class="title">
            <br>Why imageboards?
        </span>
        
        <span class="text">
            <p><br>Anonymous posting.
            <br>(Which could be a double-edged sword, I know)</p>
            
            <p><br>It means you can speak your mind without any repercussions.
            <br>Well.. except all the angry replies.</p>

            <br>Moderation
        </span>
        <span class="text">
            <p><br>I will be moderating to a certain extent on my own. 
            <br>Being the admin I can see every poster's IP address, 
            <br>If you are not comfortable with that you can use a vpn. 
            <br>This also seems like the perfect time to affirm that 
            <br>I ""DO NOT"" hold responsibility for any content posted to the board.</p>

            <br>"Can I fork the project?"
        </span>
        
        <span class="text">
            <p><br>There isn't much of a "project" here if it wasn't obvious. 
            <br>The whole thing is based on tinyib-mappy
            <br>with minor functional changes and a lot of cosmetical changes.</p>

            <p>You're better off taking a look at <a href="https://code.ivysaur.me/tinyib-mappy" style="text-decoration: none;">tinyib-mappy</a> if interested.</p>
